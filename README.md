### Overview
I created this project to provide a platform for individuals passionate about writing and sharing their blogs. As someone who loves reading technical blog posts and writing few myself, I think this website would be very helpful for the people who share the same passion as mine. I have added 6 categories - Art, Science, Technology, Cinema, Design and Food, into which people can create blog post. My main motivation behind developing this website was, I wanted a single place to save blogs I find interesting from different sources.
